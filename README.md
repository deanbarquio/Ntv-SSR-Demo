# Angular SSR Demo App

A comprehensive demonstration of Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Angular 20+. This app showcases the power and benefits of SSR including improved SEO, faster initial page loads, and enhanced user experience.

## 🚀 Features

- **Server-Side Rendering**: Content is pre-rendered on the server for optimal SEO and performance
- **Hydration**: Seamless transition from static server content to interactive client-side app
- **Modern Angular 20+**: Built with the latest Angular features including signals and standalone components
- **Responsive Design**: Modern, mobile-friendly UI with beautiful animations
- **Interactive Components**: Forms, product listings, and dynamic content that work both server-side and client-side
- **Real-time Data**: Live charts and performance metrics that demonstrate SSR vs CSR differences

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Start the SSR server:**
   ```bash
   npm run serve:ssr:angular-ssr-app
   ```

## 🌐 Running the App

### Development Mode
```bash
npm start
```
Access the app at `http://localhost:4200`

### SSR Mode
```bash
npm run build
npm run serve:ssr:angular-ssr-app
```
Access the SSR version at `http://localhost:4000`

## 🧪 Testing SSR Features

### 1. View Page Source
- Right-click on any page and select "View Page Source"
- You'll see fully rendered HTML content, not just a shell
- This demonstrates that content is rendered on the server

### 2. Disable JavaScript
- Open browser dev tools and disable JavaScript
- Navigate through the app - content is still visible
- This shows SSR works without client-side JavaScript

### 3. Check Network Tab
- Open browser dev tools and go to Network tab
- Refresh the page and look at the initial HTML response
- You'll see complete HTML content, not just a loading state

### 4. Compare Loading Times
- Test both development mode (client-side) and SSR mode
- Notice faster initial content visibility with SSR
- Observe the smooth hydration process

### 5. Real-time Data Updates
- Visit the Reports page to see real-time data updates
- Notice how charts update every 2 seconds on the client-side
- Compare initial server-rendered data with dynamic client updates
